"""
Performance Investigation Workflow

This complex workflow coordinates multiple agents to investigate and diagnose
performance issues on an IBM i system using Agno workflow conventions.

Use case: Users report slowness, admin needs to identify root cause and
provide recommendations.

Workflow steps:
1. Performance agent gathers comprehensive metrics
2. Discovery agent identifies relevant monitoring services
3. Performance agent performs deep analysis using reasoning
4. Generates detailed report with prioritized recommendations

An IBM i admin runs this workflow when:
- Users report system slowness
- Scheduled deep performance analysis is needed
- After system changes to verify no performance degradation

    ## AVAILABLE MONITORING SERVICES:

    ## YOUR DEEP ANALYSIS TASKS:

    1. **Pattern Analysis**:
       - Analyze CPU usage patterns vs. job activity
       - Examine memory pool utilization vs. thread counts
       - Identify I/O patterns and potential bottlenecks
       - Look for temporal trends in the metrics

    2. **Use Reasoning Tools**:
       - Use think() to structure your diagnostic approach
       - Use analyze() to examine metric relationships and correlations
       - Consider multiple hypotheses for root causes
       - Evaluate system architecture implications

    3. **Identify Specific Issues**:
       - Resource contentions
       - Configuration problems
       - Capacity limitations
       - Workload imbalances

    4. **Assess Severity and Impact**:
       - Critical issues requiring immediate action
       - Performance degradation affecting users
       - Efficiency improvements for optimization
       - Preventive measures for future issues

    Show your reasoning process for the diagnosis.

            - Users are reporting system slowness
            - This is a comprehensive performance investigation
            - We need to identify root causes and provide actionable recommendations

            INITIAL METRICS TASK:
            Gather comprehensive performance metrics including:
            - Overall system status (CPU, memory, I/O)
            - System activity metrics
            - Memory pool utilization
            - HTTP server performance
            - Active job information for top CPU consumers
            - Temporary storage usage
            - System values affecting performance

            MONITORING SERVICES TASK:
            After metrics are gathered, identify:
            - Service categories related to performance monitoring
            - QSYS2 services for deeper performance analysis
            - Services that could help with root cause analysis
            - Job queue and process management services

            RECOMMENDATIONS TASK:
            Based on the complete analysis, provide:

            1. **Immediate Actions** (Critical - Do Now):
               - Issues causing active performance problems
               - Steps to stabilize the system
               - Estimated time and expected impact

            2. **Short-term Improvements** (High Priority - This Week):
               - Configuration optimizations
               - Resource reallocation recommendations
               - Implementation guidance

            3. **Long-term Optimizations** (Medium Priority - This Month):
               - Capacity planning recommendations
               - Architecture improvements
               - Best practice implementations

            4. **Preventive Measures**:
               - Early warning indicators to monitor
               - Alert thresholds to configure
               - Regular maintenance tasks

            For each recommendation explain WHY, WHAT, IMPACT, and RISKS.
