System Health Audit Workflow

This workflow provides a comprehensive system health audit combining performance
monitoring, service discovery, and best practices validation.

Use case: Monthly health checks, pre/post-maintenance validation, compliance audits.

A DB admin or system admin runs this workflow to:
- Validate system configuration against best practices
- Identify potential reliability or performance issues
- Generate audit trail documentation
- Provide compliance-ready health reports

This workflow demonstrates conditional execution based on findings.

            Perform a comprehensive system health audit of our IBM i system.

            INITIAL HEALTH CHECK:
            Assess the following areas:
            1. **Performance Metrics**:
               - CPU utilization and trends
               - Memory pool health and pressure
               - I/O throughput and wait times
               - Active job resource consumption
               - HTTP server performance

            2. **Resource Availability**:
               - Temporary storage utilization
               - Storage headroom
               - Thread pool availability
               - Connection pool health

            3. **System Configuration**:
               - Key system values
               - Collection Services configuration
               - Memory pool allocation

            Identify any areas of concern requiring deeper investigation.

            IF ISSUES FOUND - DEEP INVESTIGATION:
            For any issues identified:
            - Discover diagnostic services relevant to the issue
            - Review configuration details for affected components

               - Configuration compliance status
               - Identified issues with severity levels
               - Resource utilization analysis

            3. **Recommendations**:
               - Immediate actions required (Critical)
               - Short-term improvements (High Priority)
               - Optimization opportunities (Medium Priority)
               - Best practice implementations (Low Priority)

            4. **Compliance & Documentation**:
               - System configuration snapshot
               - Performance baselines
               - Audit trail for compliance
               - Monitoring recommendations
