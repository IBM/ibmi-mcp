Service Discovery Workflow

This workflow helps admins explore available IBM i services and understand
what's available on their system.

Use case: New admin learning about system capabilities or looking for
specific services to accomplish a task.

An IBM i admin runs this workflow to:
- Discover what service categories exist
- Understand the scope of available services
- Find services relevant to their task
