# Quick Start Guide

Get your IBM i MCP Server up and running in under 15 minutes. This guide walks you through installation, configuration, and your first successful tool execution.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**: You'll need access to an IBM i system with appropriate database authorities and Node.js 18+ installed on your development machine.
</Note>

## Step 1: Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajshedivy/ibmi-mcp-server.git
cd ibmi-mcp-server
npm install
```

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

<Tip>
Use `npm run rebuild` for a clean install if you encounter any issues.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Configuration

Create your environment configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your IBM i connection details:

```bash
# IBM i DB2 for i Connection Settings
DB2i_HOST=your-ibmi-host
DB2i_USER=your-username
DB2i_PASS=your-password
DB2i_PORT=8076
DB2i_IGNORE_UNAUTHORIZED=true

# Server Configuration
MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE=http
MCP_HTTP_PORT=3010
```

<Warning>
Replace the connection values with your actual IBM i system credentials. The user profile must have appropriate authorities for database operations.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Need to set up Mapepire?** If you don't have Mapepire running on your IBM i system yet, follow our [Setup Mapepire guide](/setup-mapepire) to install and configure the database connectivity layer.
</Note>

## Step 3: Start the Server

Launch the MCP server in HTTP mode:

```bash
npm run start:http
```

You should see output similar to:

```
âœ“ Server ready!
  Transport: http
  Host: 127.0.0.1:3010
  Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:3010/mcp
```

<Success>
Your IBM i MCP Server is now running and ready to accept connections!
</Success>

## Step 4: Test with MCP Inspector

The easiest way to test your server is with the MCP Inspector tool.

Create the inspector configuration:

```bash
cp template_mcp.json mcp.json
```

Edit `mcp.json` with your connection details:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "default-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TOOLS_YAML_PATH": "prebuiltconfigs",
        "DB2i_HOST": "your-ibmi-host",
        "DB2i_USER": "your-username",
        "DB2i_PASS": "your-password",
        "DB2i_PORT": "8076",
        "MCP_TRANSPORT_TYPE": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Start the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npm run mcp-inspector
```

Open the URL shown in your browser (typically `http://localhost:6274`).

## Step 5: Execute Your First Tool

In the MCP Inspector:

1. **View Available Tools**: You should see several IBM i tools like `system_status`, `active_job_info`, etc.

2. **Execute a Tool**: Click on `system_status` and then "Execute Tool"

3. **View Results**: You should see IBM i system performance data returned as JSON

<Accordion title="Example system_status output">
```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "System Status Results: {\n  \"SYSTEM_NAME\": \"YOURSYSTEM\",\n  \"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\": \"2024-01-15-10.30.45.123456\",\n  \"CPU_UTILIZATION\": 15.2,\n  \"MEMORY_USED_MB\": 8192,\n  \"DISK_UTILIZATION\": 45.8\n}"
    }
  ]
}
```
</Accordion>

## Step 6: Build an Agent

Test with the included Python agent examples:

```bash
cd agents

# Install dependencies and run an agent
uv run agent.py -p "What is my system status?"
```

The agent will connect to your running server and execute the `system_status` tool, returning a natural language summary of your IBM i system performance.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection Refused" icon="">
    - Verify your IBM i host is reachable: `ping your-ibmi-host`
    - Check that the Mapepire daemon is running on port 8076
    - Ensure your user profile has database authorities
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Failed" icon="">
    - Verify your IBM i username and password are correct
    - Check that your user profile is not disabled or expired
    - Ensure you have appropriate authorities for QSYS2 services
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Port Already in Use" icon="">
    Change the port in your `.env` file:
    ```bash
    MCP_HTTP_PORT=3011
    ```
    Then restart the server.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tools Not Loading" icon="">
    - Check that `prebuiltconfigs/` directory exists
    - Verify your YAML tool configurations are valid
    - Use `--list-toolsets` to see available tools:
    ```bash
    npm run start:http -- --list-toolsets
    ```
