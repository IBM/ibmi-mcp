# Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI agents to securely access and interact with your data and systems. For IBM i professionals, MCP provides a bridge between modern AI applications and traditional enterprise systems, maintaining the security and reliability standards you expect.

<Note>
Think of MCP as a standardized API that AI agents understand natively. Instead of building custom integrations for each AI tool, MCP provides a universal interface that works with any MCP-compatible agent.
</Note>

## What Problem Does MCP Solve?

Traditional AI applications face significant challenges when working with enterprise data:

graph LR
    subgraph "AI Agent"
        A[Claude, GPT, etc.] --> B[MCP Client]
    end

    subgraph "IBM i Environment"
        D[IBM i MCP Server] --> E[DB2 for i]
        D --> F[System Services]
        D --> G[Business Data]
    end

    B <--> C[MCP Protocol]
    C <--> D

    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
    style E fill:#fff3e0
```

### The MCP Conversation Flow

Here's what happens when an AI agent needs information from your IBM i system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Agent Request">
    The AI agent identifies a need for data and makes a request through MCP:

    ```json
    {
      "method": "tools/call",
      "params": {
        "name": "query_active_jobs",
        "arguments": {
          "user_filter": "ACCOUNTING",
          "max_rows": 10
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="2. Server Processing">
    The MCP server validates the request and executes it against IBM i:

    - ✅ Authentication check (is user authorized?)
    - ✅ Parameter validation (are inputs safe?)
    - ✅ Authority verification (can user access this data?)
    - ✅ SQL execution with proper binding
    - ✅ Result formatting and return
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="3. Structured Response">
    The agent receives structured data it can understand and act upon:

    ```json
    {
      "content": [{
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Found 8 active jobs for ACCOUNTING department..."
      }],
      "structuredContent": {
        "jobs": [
          {"job_name": "PAYROLL01", "user": "ACCUSER1", "status": "ACTIVE"},
          {"job_name": "REPORTS", "user": "ACCUSER2", "status": "ACTIVE"}
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## MCP Components and Concepts

Understanding these key concepts will help you work effectively with MCP:

### Tools

**Tools** are discrete operations that AI agents can perform through MCP. In the IBM i context, tools typically:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Query Data" icon="search">
    Execute SQL queries against DB2 for i tables and views

    ```yaml
    tools:
      system_status:
        description: "Get current system performance metrics"
        statement: "SELECT * FROM qsys2.system_status_info"
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="System Operations" icon="cog">
    Perform system administration tasks and monitoring

    ```yaml
    tools:
      check_subsystems:
        description: "List active subsystem status"
        statement: "SELECT * FROM qsys2.subsystem_info WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'"
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Business Logic" icon="calculator">
    Execute stored procedures and business functions

    ```yaml
    tools:
      calculate_inventory:
        description: "Run inventory calculation procedure"
        statement: "CALL mylib.calc_inventory(:product_line)"
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Report Generation" icon="chart-bar">
    Generate formatted reports and summaries

    ```yaml
    tools:
      monthly_sales:
        description: "Generate monthly sales summary"
        statement: "SELECT * FROM sales_summary WHERE month = :target_month"
    ```
  </Card>
</Columns>

### Resources

**Resources** represent data that can be retrieved and analyzed. Unlike tools that perform actions, resources provide static or semi-static content:

- Configuration files and documentation
- Reference data and lookup tables
- System catalogs and metadata
- Log files and audit trails

### Capabilities

MCP servers declare their **capabilities** to inform clients about supported features:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "resources": { "listChanged": true },
    "tools": { "listChanged": true },
    "logging": {}
  }
}
```

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Security Layers"
        A[User Authentication] --> B[Tool Authorization]
        B --> C[Parameter Validation]
        C --> D[IBM i Authority Check]
        D --> E[SQL Security Validation]
        E --> F[Audit Logging]
    end

    subgraph "Trust Boundaries"
        G[AI Agent] --> H[MCP Protocol]
        H --> I[IBM i MCP Server]
        I --> J[IBM i System]
    end

    style A fill:#ffebee
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
    style F fill:#f3e5f5
```

### Key Security Principles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Principle of Least Privilege" icon="lock">
    AI agents can only access tools and data explicitly made available through the MCP server configuration. There's no blanket access to your systems.

    ```yaml
    # Only specific tools are exposed
    toolsets:
      read_only_reports:
        tools: [sales_summary, inventory_levels]
        # No access to payroll, financial, or system administration tools
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication Required" icon="user-check">
    All access requires valid authentication. The IBM i MCP Server supports multiple auth modes including IBM i HTTP authentication with encrypted credential exchange.

    ```bash
    # User must authenticate before any tool access
    MCP_AUTH_MODE=ibmi
    IBMI_HTTP_AUTH_ENABLED=true
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transparent Audit Trail" icon="eye">
    All operations are logged with full context, including user identity, requested operations, and results. Perfect for compliance and security monitoring.

    ```json
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z",
      "user": "JSMITH",
      "tool": "query_customer_data",
      "parameters": {"customer_id": "12345"},
      "result": "success"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
