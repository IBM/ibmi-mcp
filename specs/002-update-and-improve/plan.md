# Implementation Plan: Documentation Improvement and Restructuring

**Branch**: `002-update-and-improve` | **Date**: 2025-09-23 | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-update-and-improve/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Create comprehensive, well-structured Mintlify documentation for the IBM i MCP server by completely rewriting the existing docs/ directory. The documentation will target technical users familiar with IBM i, programming, and SQL but potentially new to MCP/AI concepts, providing both accessible entry points and in-depth technical guides.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript for MCP server, Mintlify MDX for documentation
**Primary Dependencies**: Mintlify documentation platform, Mermaid for diagrams
**Storage**: File-based documentation in docs/ directory with Mintlify configuration
**Testing**: Content validation through actual server code verification
**Target Platform**: Web-based documentation site via Mintlify
**Project Type**: Documentation (single project with structured content)
**Performance Goals**: 15-minute quickstart completion time, clear navigation
**Constraints**: Must be based on actual server code, no hallucinated content
**Scale/Scope**: Complete documentation rewrite covering 8 major topic areas

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**✅ Simplicity & Ergonomics**: Documentation prioritizes ease of use for developers building MCP tools and agents for IBM i systems

**✅ Thoughtful Customization**: Configuration guides will be intuitive and well-documented for tailoring to specific IBM i environments

**✅ Security First**: Documentation will emphasize security best practices for authentication, authorization, and data protection

**✅ Testability & Reliability**: Documentation examples will be based on tested server code and include validation steps

**✅ Observability & Maintainability**: Documentation will include logging, monitoring, and diagnostic guidance

**✅ IBM i System Respect**: Content will respect enterprise IBM i environment characteristics, emphasizing stability and security

**✅ Enterprise-First Design**: Documentation will address enterprise operational requirements including auditability and compliance

**✅ Clarity Over Cleverness**: Documentation will favor explicit, clear explanations over clever or implicit approaches

**✅ Composable Tool Architecture**: Documentation will explain how MCP tools work together and complement existing IBM i tooling

**✅ Mapepire Compatibility**: Documentation will ensure compatibility with Mapepire architecture and design principles

**Structure Decision**: Documentation project (single project structure with organized content hierarchy)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Research Tasks Identified**:

1. **Mintlify Best Practices**: Research Mintlify documentation platform capabilities, MDX features, navigation patterns
2. **MCP Documentation Standards**: Research Model Context Protocol documentation standards and examples
3. **IBM i Documentation Patterns**: Research enterprise IBM i documentation approaches and terminology
4. **Current Server Architecture**: Analyze existing server codebase to understand architecture patterns
5. **SQL Tools Implementation**: Research YAML-based SQL tool configuration and execution patterns
6. **Authentication Flows**: Research IBM i HTTP authentication implementation details
7. **Agent Development Patterns**: Research agent development workflows and examples
8. **Deployment Options**: Research current deployment methods and configuration options

**Research consolidated in research.md with decisions, rationales, and alternatives considered**

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

**Documentation Content Model** → `data-model.md`:
- Documentation pages with metadata (title, description, audience)
- Navigation structure with hierarchical organization
- Code examples with validation requirements
- Diagrams with Mermaid specifications
- Configuration references with environment variables

**Content Contracts** from functional requirements:
- Quickstart completion in ≤15 minutes
- Architecture clarity with Mermaid diagrams
- SQL tool creation workflow with examples
- Agent building guidance with working examples
- Deployment scenarios with configuration details

**Content Validation Tests**:
- Link verification across all documentation
- Code example execution validation
- Mermaid diagram rendering verification
- Configuration completeness checks

**Quickstart Extraction** from user stories:
- New developer experience validation
- SQL tool creation workflow testing
- Agent development workflow testing

**CLAUDE.md Update**:
- Add Mintlify documentation context
- Include documentation validation approaches
- Preserve existing architectural guidelines

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Generate tasks from documentation content model and contracts
- Each major documentation section → content creation task
- Each diagram requirement → Mermaid diagram creation task
- Each code example → validation and testing task
- Navigation and cross-reference → integration task

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Foundation first: index, quickstart, configuration
- Core concepts: architecture, MCP overview
- Implementation guides: SQL tools, agents, deployment
- Reference materials: API documentation
- Integration tasks: navigation, cross-references, validation

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks covering complete documentation rewrite

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (content review, link verification, quickstart testing)

## Complexity Tracking

_No constitutional violations identified - documentation aligns with all constitutional principles_

## Progress Tracking

_This checklist is updated during execution flow_

**Phase Status**:

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
