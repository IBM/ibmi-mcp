# Feature Specification: Documentation Improvement and Restructuring

**Feature Branch**: `002-update-and-improve`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Update and improve the documentation in this repo. in the docs/ folder, there is a mintlfy site config with some tempalte and example docs, but the quality of the documentation is poor and fragmented. This tasks main goal is create well structured, well documented, and clear documentation about this MCP server. The main Readme has the best docs and should be used as a starting point. here are the areas that need to be focused on: server quickstart, server configuration, building sql tools, building agents for this mcp server, general server archeteture, developing and testing sql tools, deployment options (running the server), and current usecases. The documentation should follow a consistent format and use diagrams and mintlify artifacts like sections, badges, and links. No information should be hallicinated or made up. USe the actual server code as the source of truth. The current docs/ directory should be completely rewritten and re organized to confine with these instructions."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

**As a technical user with IBM i, programming, and SQL experience but potentially new to MCP/AI concepts**, I want comprehensive, well-organized documentation for the IBM i MCP server so that I can quickly understand how to set up, configure, use, and extend the server for my specific needs, with both accessible entry points and in-depth technical guides available.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new developer wants to start using the IBM i MCP server, **When** they access the documentation, **Then** they should find a clear quickstart guide that gets them running within 15 minutes
2. **Given** a developer needs to create custom SQL tools, **When** they consult the documentation, **Then** they should find step-by-step instructions with complete examples
3. **Given** a system administrator needs to deploy the server, **When** they review deployment options, **Then** they should understand all available deployment methods with configuration details
4. **Given** an AI engineer wants to build agents using this MCP server, **When** they read the agent guides, **Then** they should understand the architecture and have working examples
5. **Given** a developer needs to troubleshoot issues, **When** they search the documentation, **Then** they should find detailed troubleshooting guides with common problems and solutions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when users need advanced configuration options not covered in basic setup?
- How does the documentation handle different deployment scenarios (development vs. production)?
- What guidance is provided for users migrating from other MCP servers?
- How are version-specific differences documented?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Documentation MUST provide a complete quickstart guide that allows new users to have the server running within 15 minutes
- **FR-002**: Documentation MUST include comprehensive server configuration reference with all environment variables and their purposes
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST provide detailed instructions for building SQL tools using YAML configuration
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST include guides for building agents that interact with the MCP server
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST explain the server architecture with clear diagrams and component relationships
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST cover developing and testing SQL tools with examples and best practices
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST document all deployment options including development, Docker, and production scenarios
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST include current use cases with practical examples and implementation details
- **FR-009**: Documentation MUST use consistent formatting throughout with Mintlify components (sections, badges, links)
- **FR-010**: Documentation MUST be based entirely on actual server code without hallucinated information, starting fresh rather than migrating existing docs content
- **FR-011**: Documentation MUST be logically organized with clear navigation structure
- **FR-012**: Documentation MUST include Mermaid diagrams embedded in markdown for execution flows and high-level architecture where they add clarity
- **FR-013**: Documentation MAY include basic FAQ-style troubleshooting (low priority, can be deferred to future feature)
- **FR-014**: Documentation MUST include high-level API references for MCP and authentication endpoints, clearly organized but not as primary focus
- **FR-015**: Documentation MUST have cross-references between related sections

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Documentation Pages**: Individual markdown files covering specific topics with consistent structure
- **Navigation Structure**: Hierarchical organization of content with logical grouping
- **Code Examples**: Working, tested examples extracted from actual server implementation
- **Diagrams**: Visual representations of architecture, flows, and relationships
- **Configuration Reference**: Comprehensive listing of all configurable options
- **Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios demonstrating server capabilities

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23

- Q: What is the target audience expertise level for the documentation? → A: Technical users with IBM i, programming, and SQL familiarity but potentially new to MCP/AI concepts; provide both accessible entry points and in-depth technical guides
- Q: How should existing content migration be handled? → A: Start fresh, only referencing existing content for accuracy verification
- Q: What level of diagram detail is expected for architecture and authentication flows? → A: Valid Mermaid diagrams embedded in markdown, focused on execution flows and high-level architecture where they add clarity
- Q: How comprehensive should the troubleshooting coverage be? → A: FAQ-style format, can be left for future feature - do not focus on troubleshooting guides
- Q: What depth of API reference documentation is needed? → A: High-level MCP and auth endpoints, clearly organized, not primary focus
