# Feature Specification: Simplify and Consolidate YAML Utilities

**Feature Branch**: `001-simplify-and-consolidate`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "simplify and consolidate the yaml utilities in the ibmi-mcp-server. Find ghost code and remove and clean up yaml tool management process files to target: @src/ibmi-mcp-server/utils/yaml/yamlConfigBuilder.ts @src/ibmi-mcp-server/utils/yaml/yamlToolsLoader.ts @src/ibmi-mcp-server/utils/yaml/yamlToolFactory.ts"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identified: simplify YAML utilities, remove ghost code, consolidate management files
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: developers maintaining the codebase
   � Actions: refactor, consolidate, remove unused code
   � Data: YAML tool configuration files and processing classes
   � Constraints: maintain existing functionality while reducing complexity
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Performance impact expectations: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance targets]
   � Breaking change tolerance: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: API compatibility requirements]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flow: developers working with cleaner, simpler YAML utility code
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement focused on code quality and maintainability improvements
6. Identify Key Entities
   � YAML configuration classes, utility functions, management processes
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Architecture-focused feature with clear consolidation targets
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY (cleaner, simpler codebase)
- L Avoid HOW to implement (specific refactoring techniques)
- =e Written for technical stakeholders and code maintainers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the IBM i MCP server, I need the YAML utility system to be simple and well-organized so I can understand, maintain, and extend YAML tool functionality without getting lost in complex, duplicated, or unused code.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a developer needs to modify YAML tool behavior, **When** they examine the YAML utilities, **Then** they should find clear, single-purpose classes with minimal duplication
2. **Given** a developer needs to debug YAML tool registration, **When** they trace through the code, **Then** they should follow a straightforward path without encountering unused or legacy code
3. **Given** a developer needs to add new YAML tool features, **When** they extend the system, **Then** they should work with a consolidated architecture that has clear separation of concerns

### Edge Cases

- What happens when existing YAML tools continue to work after consolidation?
- How does the system handle migration from old to new consolidated classes?
- What happens when developers use deprecated methods during transition?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST eliminate all duplicate code between yamlConfigBuilder, yamlToolsLoader, and yamlToolFactory
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove all unused methods and deprecated wrapper functions identified as "ghost code"
- **FR-003**: System MUST consolidate overlapping responsibilities into single-purpose classes
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain existing YAML tool functionality during and after consolidation
- **FR-005**: System MUST reduce total lines of code in YAML utilities by at least 30%
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve all public APIs during transition period
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear migration path for any breaking changes
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain or improve performance of YAML tool processing
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure all existing tests continue to pass after refactoring

### Key Entities

- **YamlConfigBuilder**: Configuration parsing and caching with file watching capabilities
- **YamlToolsLoader**: Main orchestrator for YAML tool loading and registration process
- **YamlToolFactory**: Dynamic MCP tool generation from YAML definitions
- **ToolConfigBuilder**: Standardized tool configuration creation (newer, cleaner approach)
- **ToolConfigCache**: Pre-processed tool configuration caching system
- **Ghost Code**: Unused methods, deprecated wrappers, and duplicate implementations
